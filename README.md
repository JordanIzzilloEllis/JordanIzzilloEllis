- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JordanIzzilloEllis
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in developing responsive web applications.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JavaScript & C# so I can improve my knowledge of Front-End and Back-End development (vanilla JavaScript at the moment but I aim to transition to React.js).
- ðŸ“« You can reach me at jdellis410@gmail.com

To see my most recent work, I'd recommend checking out the FormulaWin repository.
